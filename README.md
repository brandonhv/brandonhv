## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Brandon, I'm a full stack software engineer with experience across a variety of technologies and languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Jest, Kubernetes), and have built several web applications / developer tools with React / Node.js.

Highlights:

👨🏻‍💻 I cofounded Kube-Est8 - an open source developer tool designed to help monitor the bottleneck status of Kubernetes Nodes. Check out my pinned repositories to see Kube-Est8, as well as some other projects I have worked on.

🤝 I’m always excited to collaborate on any open source project where there is a need in the community! I'm comfortable across the full stack and i'm always excited to learn a new technology.

🍵 Outside of coding I love to Try New Cafes with my girlfriend and spending time with family, and i think doing boldering with my brother is really cool!
